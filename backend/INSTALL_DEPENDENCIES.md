# Install Dependencies

## Issue
The error shows that `multer` and other packages are not installed.

## Solution

Run this command in your Git Bash terminal (in the backend folder):

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

This will install all required dependencies including:
- multer (for file uploads)
- cloudinary (for image storage)
- All other backend dependencies

## After Installation

Once `npm install` completes, you can start the server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server should start without errors!
